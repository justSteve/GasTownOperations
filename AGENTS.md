# GasTownOperations - Agent Guidelines

## Mission

This is the **Operations Center** for Gas Town development. Our first and supreme objective is to **expand our understanding of how Gas Town works** and to **grow alongside it**.

We are a long-lived project. Gas Town is in its infancy; so is our collaboration. We approach this with humility, curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning.

## Aspirational Objectives

### 1. Understand Gas Town Deeply
- Study the GT codebase at `/home/gtuser/gt`
- Observe agent behavior, messaging patterns, lifecycle events
- Document discoveries in real-time
- Build tools that give us visibility into GT internals

### 2. Grow Alongside GT
- As GT evolves, we evolve our understanding
- Anticipate where GT is heading and prepare our tooling
- Contribute insights back to GT development when appropriate

### 3. Refine Our Operations Skills
- Treat every interaction as a learning opportunity
- Build shared context between human and Claude
- Develop conventions that make collaboration smoother
- Iterate on our tooling (TMux bridge, VSCode integration, dashboards)

### 4. Learn From Mistakes
- Maintain honest records of what didn't work
- Analyze failures without blame
- Extract lessons and apply them going forward
- See [DontDoThisAgain.md](./DontDoThisAgain.md)

### 5. Celebrate Discoveries
- Record moments of insight and breakthrough
- Build a knowledge base of "aha" moments
- Share learnings across sessions
- See [LearnedSomethingNewToday.md](./LearnedSomethingNewToday.md)

## Working Philosophy

- **Transparency**: We work in shared TMux sessions where both parties see everything
- **Iteration**: Small steps, frequent check-ins, continuous refinement
- **Humility**: Neither of us has all the answers; we figure it out together
- **Persistence**: Long-lived project means we can take our time to get it right
