## Local Only (Not on GitHub)

| Repo | Local Path | Local Branch | Last Commit |

| Bitwarden | `/mnt/c/myStuff/Bitwarden` | main | 2025-11-28 |

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Repos in Only One Location

**Local only (no GitHub match):**
- **Bitwarden** at `/mnt/c/myStuff/Bitwarden` - may need to be pushed to GitHub

**GitHub only:** 57 repos exist on GitHub but are not cloned locally.
Of these, 38 are forks and 19 are owned repos.

### Source of Truth Recommendations

- **GitHub** is the recommended source of truth for all repos (per task requirements)
- Local clones should be treated as working copies
- Exception: repos with unpushed local work should be reviewed before assuming GitHub is authoritative

### Notes

- `/root/projects` does not exist on this system - no repos to scan there
- Local repo names sometimes differ from GitHub names (e.g., `myDSPy` local dir = `dspy` on GitHub, `Judge0` local dir = `judge0` on GitHub)
- `IDEasPlatform` uses `main` on GitHub but `master` locally with different default branch values - may indicate divergence
- `beads_viewer` is nested inside the `beads` repo at `/mnt/c/myStuff/_infra/beads/beads_viewer`
