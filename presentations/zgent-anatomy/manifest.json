  "description": "Walks through the complete anatomy of a Zgent using an organism metaphor -- skeleton (ECC), nervous system (CrudEngine), senses (AOE), voice (API), habitat (tmuxMOO). Traces the lineage from 1995 MOO objects to 2026 Claude Code agents.",
  "narrativeArc": "The presentation builds an anatomical metaphor: a Zgent is a complete organism, not just an agent with config files. Each layer (skeleton, nerves, senses, voice, habitat) maps to a specific subsystem. The deeper insight: this is architectural continuity from 1995 MOO VEEs -- the concept was right, the technology finally caught up.",
