# The Convergence Map

**Meta-synthesis presentation** across the Gas Town ecosystem.

## What This Is

This presentation looks across all domains of work -- ECC, CrudEngine, AOE, tmuxMOO, BRIEFING, Zgent ecosystem -- and identifies where patterns repeat, where non-obvious connections exist, and what emergent architecture is forming. It surfaces seven structural connections between seemingly separate work streams and reveals them as three projections of one coherent system.

## Slide Overview

| # | Title | Key Idea |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | Title | The Convergence Map -- Where Everything Connects |
| 2 | The Landscape | Three seemingly separate work streams: Infrastructure, Interaction, Ecosystem |
| 3 | The Suspicion | These are not separate -- they are three projections of one system |
| 4 | Connection 1: Observability IS the Product | The stack exists to make agents observable; observability is the user interface |
| 5 | Connection 2: Rooms All the Way Down | Pane, log directory, scene, context profile -- four names for "bounded agent environment" |
| 6 | Connection 3: Traffic Logs = Narrative Replay | CrudEngine audit trail is the raw data for tmuxMOO replay mode |
| 7 | Connection 4: Presentations as API | Zgent Presentation Standard and API publication converge -- same requirement at different abstraction levels |
| 8 | Connection 5: The COO as World Builder | ECC defines, CrudEngine instantiates, Explorer executes, tmuxMOO displays -- the COO orchestrates all four |
| 9 | Connection 6: Academy = Test Suite | Graduation criteria map directly to test categories -- the Academy automates itself |
| 10 | Connection 7: Scene = Room = Context | Three domain-specific names for one primitive: bounded agent environment |
| 11 | The Unified Architecture | Complete picture -- all three layers as one coherent system (main Mermaid diagram) |
| 12 | What This Means | One thing built from three angles: programmable, inhabitable, interoperable |
| 13 | The Gaps | Where convergence is incomplete: unified types, replay adapter, Academy pipeline, auto-generation |
| 14 | The 30-Year Arc | MOO VEE (1995) to Strades vision (2025) to Gas Town (2026) |
| 15 | What Comes Next | Architectural and immediate work items generated by this analysis |
| 16 | Questions / Close | Master insight restated |

## Seven Connections

1. **Observability IS the Product** -- tmuxMOO, traffic logs, and events are three surfaces of one product
2. **Rooms All the Way Down** -- pane, log directory, scene, context profile are isomorphic
3. **Traffic Logs = Narrative Replay** -- CrudEngine audit trail feeds tmuxMOO replay
4. **Presentations as API** -- the presentation standard IS human-readable API documentation
5. **The COO as World Builder** -- define, instantiate, execute, display
6. **Academy = Test Suite** -- graduation criteria map to automated test categories
7. **Scene = Room = Context** -- three names for one primitive that should converge

## Four Gaps Identified

1. Scene / Room / Context have no shared schema (needs BoundedEnvironment type)
2. Academy pipeline is not wired to CrudEngine (graduation checks should be automated queries)
3. Traffic log to tmuxMOO replay adapter does not exist (data and display are disconnected)
4. Presentation auto-generation from metadata is not implemented

## Diagrams
