  "narrativeArc": "The presentation starts with three seemingly separate work streams, builds suspicion that they are connected, then proves it with seven specific connections. Each connection should feel like a small revelation; together they are overwhelming. The master insight: we are not building three things -- we are building one thing from three angles. The convergence was not planned; it emerged from following observability-first consistently.",
