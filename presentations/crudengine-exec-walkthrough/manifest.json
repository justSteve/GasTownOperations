  "narrativeArc": "The presentation frames the scaling problem (manual config fails at 20+ agents), introduces CrudEngine as the solution (unified CRUD with full observability), and demonstrates the business value (audit trail, versioning, real-time events). The deeper point: CrudEngine is not just a tool -- it is the trust layer that must be bulletproof before Zgents go production.",
