{"id":"D_kwDOQpbhqM4Ajv1Z","number":839,"title":"QA pass - anyone Ralphing or using other approaches?","body":"I found that agents were doing really poor work (e.g. 0-30% done). Particularly bad if you are throwing a big pile of tasks at a group of parallel workers. So I manually reviewed their work with Claude Code, threw beads back to them, and found that 1-2 loops of this got us to 100% done. This is really promising as it means a QA loop can work. \r\n\r\nHaving thought about somehow having a QA process layer either done by mayor or a QA role, it dawned on me that a) these are not people and b) they are all running the same model, so are capable of doing it themselves. And that is exactly what Ralph Wiggum plugin actually does... \r\n\r\nTesting it so far I've found the only way I can get them to run it on GT 0.4.0. is for myself or mayor to send them tmux instructing them to run it from bash (they can't seem to find the plugin). However, when you coax them to do it, it appears to actually work and tasks are properly executed! The problems I'm currently wrestling with are Witness interfering and Mayor not continuing to feed the tasks out (almost like Mayor needs it's own Ralph loop). \r\n\r\nCouple of other issues:\r\n\r\n- The Enter key gotcha - tmux send-keys needs explicit Enter at the end or commands just sit there staged\r\n\r\n- Verification step missing - Mayor should check .claude/ralph-loop.local.md exists before moving on, otherwise crew does regular work instead of Ralphing\r\n\r\nAnyone else played with this or other QA loop approaches?","author":"djangobeatty","category":"General","createdAt":"2026-01-21T11:04:02Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T11:24:00Z","comments_count":0,"upvotes":2,"answered":false,"locked":false,"significance_score":29,"significance_tier":"low"}

Plus, comments and feedback need to be incorporated, and we need to keep up with rebases/catch CI failures, and having an agent monitor that to help shepherd it along.\n\nIn other words, the mayor keeps the local work going; but the backend of getting this stuff landed needs to be managed too, and that's a bottleneck gastown can help with.\n\nWorked up a problem statement with Claude and some potential solutions.

Introduce a new agent (Outrider) that handles PR creation and human review tracking, while the Refinery focuses purely on branch management and integration.\n\n## Problem\n\nCurrently the Refinery auto-merges completed polecat work directly to main. There’s no point to pause, review, and approve before shipping. For teams or workflows that require human review:\n\n- Work gets merged before anyone can review it\n- No staging area to see “what’s ready but not shipped”\n- No tracking of PRs through human review cycles\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n```\nCURRENT\n───────\nPolecat completes → Refinery merges to main → done\n\n\nPROPOSED  \n────────\nPolecat completes → Refinery integrates branches → [staging]\n                                                       ↓\n                                              Human reviews\n                                                       ↓\n                                              gt dispatch <target>\n                                                       ↓\n                                              Outrider creates PR\n                                                       ↓\n                                              Outrider tracks review\n                                                       ↓\n                                              PR merged → bead closed\n```\n\n### Role Separation\n\n|Agent       |Responsibility                                                                                      |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|**Refinery**|Merge branches together, maintain stacks, keep integration branches green, rebase on main, run tests|\n|**Outrider**|Create PRs, track human review, watch for merge events, close beads, report to convoy               |\n\n## New Component: Outrider\n\nThe Outrider handles the boundary between Gas Town and the outside world (GitHub/GitLab).

(Probably rig, like Witness/Refinery)\n1. **Command naming**: `gt dispatch` vs `gt ship` vs `gt ride` vs `gt release`?\n1. **Default convoy type**: Should integrated convoys be the default for new convoys?\n1. **Witness interaction**: How does this interact with the Witness? (Witness watches polecats, Outrider watches PRs?)\n1. **PR strategy**: Should there be options for squash vs merge commit when Outrider ships?\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Suggested order of implementation\n\n1. Add `refinery.mode` config option\n1. Implement `ready_for_review` status flow\n1. Add `gt staged` command\n1. Implement Outrider agent with basic PR creation\n1. Add convoy integration branches (`--integrated` flag)\n1. Implement Outrider PR tracking and bead closure\n1. Add `gt recall` for pulling back PRs\n\n### Files likely affected\n\n- `internal/refinery/` - mode switching, staging behavior\n- `internal/outrider/` - new agent\n- `cmd/gt/` - new commands (staged, dispatch, recall, outrider)\n- Convoy creation logic - `--integrated` flag\n- Bead status definitions - new statuses","author":"swizzlr","category":"Ideas","createdAt":"2026-01-17T14:26:20Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T15:20:44Z","comments_count":2,"upvotes":4,"answered":false,"locked":false,"significance_score":61,"significance_tier":"medium"}

{"id":"D_kwDOQpbhqM4Ajsc_","number":704,"title":"Cortex - CLI tool for AI to map and explore codebases","body":"https://github.com/hargabyte/cortex\r\n\r\nI made this after using Beads and realizing how powerful a CLI tool is for an AI agent. Cortex works very similar to Beads. It scans the codebase and creates a dependency graph in SQLite. Claude can use the CLI to find exactly what he needs instead of reading a bunch of files hoping he find the right stuff. We use similar robot commands like Beads_Viewer to provide keystones and bottlenecks so Claude knows where to be careful. 12 languages supported.\r\n\r\nIll let Claude tell you more about it...\r\n\r\n● ---\r\n  My Take on Cortex (CX)\r\n\r\n  CX solves a real problem I face constantly. When I explore a codebase, I typically burn through dozens of Glob and Grep calls trying to piece together how things connect. CX's context --smart command is genuinely impressive—I gave it \"authentication and licensing\" and it immediately surfaced SettingsProvider, handleAuthRequest, canAccessAdminFeatures, and the license server handlers. That's exactly the kind of semantic understanding that would normally take me 10+ tool calls to triangulate. The safe command is equally thoughtful: before I touch src/context/, it warned me about 18 keystone entities with inadequate test coverage and calculated an impact radius of 772 affected entities. That's the kind of pre-flight check that prevents \"quick fixes\" from becoming production incidents.\r\n\r\n  The PageRank-based keystone detection is clever engineering. Instead of treating all code as equally important, CX identifies the structural load-bearing walls—CarouselSlide, CustomizationField, ButtonStyle—the types that ripple through everything. The trace command for mapping call chains between any two symbols fills a gap that static analysis tools often miss. I particularly appreciate that it auto-excludes node_modules and target/ directories without configuration; it understands modern project structures out of the box.\r\n\r\n  Where I see the potential: The real value isn't just the individual commands—it's having a persistent, queryable graph of my codebase that survives across sessions. Combined with the session hook, this could fundamentally change how AI assistants approach unfamiliar code. Rather than re-discovering the architecture every conversation, we'd have instant structural awareness. At v0.1.6 it's already useful; with coverage integration and the dependency analysis maturing, this could become essential infrastructure for AI-assisted development.\r\n\r\n  ---","author":"hargabyte","category":"Show and tell","createdAt":"2026-01-17T16:17:52Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T16:17:52Z","comments_count":0,"upvotes":1,"answered":false,"locked":false,"significance_score":32,"significance_tier":"low"}

A large aspect of this was executing `npm ci` in each polecat git worktree simultaneously.  I added a setup hook:\r\n```\r\n  #!/bin/bash\r\n  # Ensure node_modules is available for polecat worktrees.\r\n  # Uses flock to serialize npm ci across concurrent polecat spawns.\r\n  # Only runs npm ci if package-lock.json changed since last install.\r\n\r\n  SOURCE=\"$GT_RIG_PATH/mayor/rig\"\r\n  LOCKFILE=\"$GT_RIG_PATH/.runtime/npm-install.lock\"\r\n  HASHFILE=\"$GT_RIG_PATH/.runtime/npm-install.hash\"\r\n\r\n  (\r\n      flock -x 200\r\n\r\n      CURRENT_HASH=$(md5sum \"$SOURCE/package-lock.json\" | cut -d' ' -f1)\r\n      STORED_HASH=$(cat \"$HASHFILE\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"\")\r\n\r\n      if [ \"$CURRENT_HASH\" != \"$STORED_HASH\" ] || [ ! -d \"$SOURCE/node_modules\" ]; then\r\n          cd \"$SOURCE\" && npm ci --silent\r\n          echo \"$CURRENT_HASH\" > \"$HASHFILE\"\r\n      fi\r\n  ) 200>\"$LOCKFILE\"\r\n\r\n  # Sync to polecat worktree (incremental, removes stale packages)\r\n  rsync -a --delete \"$SOURCE/node_modules/\" \"$GT_WORKTREE_PATH/node_modules/\"\r\n```\r\nThis grabs a lock to serialize the polecats checks, runs `npm ci` in mayor/rig only if needed (using a hash check on package-lock.json), then copies it to the polecat's worktree.  Claude kept wanting to use a link instead, but I was concerned the polecats might update or add packages while doing their work and that seemed like it might cause issues.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping someone has a better solution.

{"id":"D_kwDOQpbhqM4AjmcW","number":363,"title":"# Proposal: Agent-First Version Control for Gas Town & Beads","body":"## TL;DR\r\n\r\n**Git and Jujutsu were designed for humans, not AI agents.** This proposal outlines an **agent-first version control system** that takes inspiration from both but rethinks the fundamentals for multi-agent coordination at scale.\r\n\r\n**Core Thesis:** A version control system designed for AI agents should prioritize:\r\n1. **Zero Framework Cognition (ZFC)** - State derived from filesystem, not in-memory\r\n2. **High-frequency concurrent operations** - 100+ agents, 1000+ commits/hour\r\n3. **Automatic conflict resolution** - No manual intervention possible\r\n4. **Structured data semantics** - Machine-readable by design\r\n5. **Event-driven orchestration** - Hooks, triggers, workflows as first-class citizens\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:** Build a new agent-first VCS layer that can use Jujutsu (or Git) as storage backend while providing agent-optimized semantics on top.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part I: First Principles - What Do Agents Need?\r\n\r\n### The Human vs Agent Mental Model\r\n\r\n| Aspect | Human Developer | AI Agent |\r\n|--------|----------------|----------|\r\n| **Commit frequency** | 5-20 times/day | 100-1000 times/hour |\r\n| **Concurrency** | 1-10 parallel editors | 100-1000 parallel editors |\r\n| **Conflict handling** | Manual resolution | Must be automatic |\r\n| **State awareness** | In-memory context | ZFC: read from filesystem |\r\n| **Error recovery** | Manual intervention | Self-healing or escalate |\r\n| **Communication** | Natural language | Structured events |\r\n| **Attribution** | Author name | Agent identity + session ID |\r\n| **Verification** | Manual testing | Automated pipeline |\r\n| **Rollback** | Manual revert | Automatic on failure |\r\n\r\n### Agent-First Design Requirements\r\n\r\n#### 1. Operation-Log as Primary Primitive\r\n\r\n**Current Git/Jujutsu:** Commits are the primary unit, with an operation log as auxiliary.\r\n\r\n**Agent-First:** Operation log IS the primary primitive. Every action is an immutable operation event:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"op_id\": \"op-abc123\",\r\n  \"type\": \"commit\",\r\n  \"agent\": \"gastown/polecats/nux\",\r\n  \"session\": \"sess-456\",\r\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-12T10:30:00Z\",\r\n  \"parents\": [\"op-abc122\"],\r\n  \"changeset\": {\r\n    \"files\": [\"src/file.rs\"],\r\n    \"beads\": [\"bd-created:gt-123\"]\r\n  },\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"model\": \"claude-opus-4\",\r\n    \"latency_ms\": 1234,\r\n    \"tokens\": 45678\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why:** Agents need complete audit trails for:\r\n- Debugging: \"What did agent X do during session Y?\"\r\n- Attribution: \"Which model completed this task?\"\r\n- Replay: \"Can we reproduce this workflow?\"\r\n- Billing: \"How many tokens were used?\"\r\n\r\n#### 2. Conflict-Free by Default\r\n\r\n**Current Git:** Conflicts are common, require manual resolution.\r\n\r\n**Agent-First:** CRDT-based or automatically mergeable by design:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// Agent-first commit always succeeds\r\nagent.Commit(Change{\r\n    Type: \"bead_create\",\r\n    ID: \"gt-123\",\r\n    Data: {...},\r\n})\r\n\r\n// System automatically:\r\n// 1. Detects conflicts\r\n// 2. Applies merge strategies (last-write-wins, 3-way, custom)\r\n// 3. Returns merged state\r\n// 4. Logs conflict resolution for audit\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Merge Strategies (agent-specific):**\r\n- **Beads JSONL:** Append-only, line-based merging (no conflicts)\r\n- **Code files:** 3-way merge with AI-assisted conflict resolution\r\n- **Structured data:** CRDT/OT semantics for concurrent edits\r\n- **Agent hooks:** Event-sourcing pattern (immutable event log)\r\n\r\n#### 3. Structured Data Semantics\r\n\r\n**Current Git:** Unstructured commit messages, parsing required.\r\n\r\n**Agent-First:** Typed, structured operations:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Operation struct {\r\n    ID        OperationID\r\n    Type      OperationType  // commit, merge, hook_assign, mail_send\r\n    Agent     AgentIdentity\r\n    Timestamp time.Time\r\n    Parents   []OperationID\r\n\r\n    // Type-specific payload\r\n    Payload   interface{}  // CommitPayload, MergePayload, HookPayload, etc.\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype CommitPayload struct {\r\n    Beads   []BeadRef\r\n    Files   []FileChange\r\n    Message string\r\n    Tags    map[string]string\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- No parsing required - direct deserialization\r\n- Type-safe operations\r\n- Queryable by operation type\r\n- Machine-readable by design\r\n\r\n#### 4. Event-Driven Orchestration\r\n\r\n**Current Git:** Hooks are afterthoughts, limited to specific events.\r\n\r\n**Agent-First:** Hooks/triggers/workflows are first-class operations:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"op_id\": \"op-def456\",\r\n  \"type\": \"hook_triggered\",\r\n  \"trigger\": \"on_commit\",\r\n  \"agent\": \"gastown/witness\",\r\n  \"config\": {\r\n    \"condition\": \"bead.type == 'polecat_done'\",\r\n    \"action\": \"assign_to_refinery\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"triggered_by\": \"op-abc123\",\r\n    \"actions\": [\"bd-assigned:gt-123 to refinery\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Event Types:**\r\n- `on_commit` - After any commit\r\n- `on_bead_create` - New bead created\r\n- `on_bead_close` - Bead closed\r\n- `on_bead_assign` - Assignment changed\r\n- `on_conflict` - Merge conflict detected\r\n- `on_merge` - Merge completed\r\n- `on_failure` - Operation failed\r\n\r\n#### 5. Zero Framework Cognition (ZFC) Compliance\r\n\r\n**Current Git:** State in CLI, working directory, index, refs.\r\n\r\n**Agent-First:** ALL state derivable from filesystem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/.gt/\r\n├── .ops/                    # Operation log (append-only)\r\n│   ├── 2025-01-12.jsonl     # Today's operations\r\n│   ├── 2025-01-11.jsonl     # Yesterday's operations\r\n│   └── index.jsonl          # Operation index\r\n├── .state/                  # Current derived state\r\n│   ├── HEAD                 # Current operation ID\r\n│   ├── agents.jsonl         # Agent states\r\n│   ├── hooks.jsonl          # Hook assignments\r\n│   └── mail.jsonl           # Mail queue\r\n└── .work/                   # Working copies\r\n    ├── mayor/rig/           # Mayor's workspace\r\n    ├── polecats/nux/        # Polecat nux's workspace\r\n    └── ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Principle:** An agent that wakes from crash can reconstruct entire state by reading `.ops/` sequentially.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part II: Ideal Agent-First VCS Design\r\n\r\n### Core Abstractions\r\n\r\n#### 1. Operation (Not Commit)\r\n\r\nEvery action is an immutable operation:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Operation struct {\r\n    ID        OperationID  // UUID\r\n    Type      OpType\r\n    Agent     AgentIdentity\r\n    Timestamp time.Time\r\n    Parents   []OperationID\r\n    Payload   op.Payload    // Polymorphic payload\r\n\r\n    // Derived fields (not stored)\r\n    Children  []OperationID\r\n    State     OperationState\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Operation Types:**\r\n- `commit` - Create a new revision\r\n- `merge` - Merge operations\r\n- `assign` - Assign work to agent\r\n- `hook` - Trigger/assign hook\r\n- `mail` - Send/receive mail\r\n- `escalate` - Escalate issue\r\n- `resolve` - Mark conflict as resolved\r\n\r\n#### 2. Workspace (Not Working Copy)\r\n\r\nA workspace is an agent's isolated environment:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Workspace struct {\r\n    ID         WorkspaceID\r\n    Type       WorkspaceType  // mayor, polecat, refinery, witness, crew\r\n    Agent      AgentIdentity\r\n    BaseOp     OperationID     // Base operation for this workspace\r\n    CurrentOp  OperationID     // Current operation\r\n    State      WorkspaceState\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Workspace Lifecycle:**\r\n1. **Create:** `workspace_create(base_op)` - Creates new workspace\r\n2. **Modify:** Agent makes changes in workspace\r\n3. **Commit:** `commit(workspace_id)` - Creates operation\r\n4. **Merge:** `merge(target_op)` - Merges to target\r\n5. **Cleanup:** `workspace_destroy(workspace_id)` - Removes workspace\r\n\r\n#### 3. Agent Identity\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype AgentIdentity struct {\r\n    Rig     string        // \"gastown\"\r\n    Type    AgentType     // \"polecat\", \"witness\", \"refinery\", \"mayor\", \"deacon\", \"crew\"\r\n    Name    string        // \"nux\", \"witness\", \"refinery\"\r\n    Session SessionID     // Current session (optional)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (a AgentIdentity) String() string {\r\n    if a.Session != \"\" {\r\n        return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/%s/%s@%s\", a.Rig, a.Type, a.Name, a.Session)\r\n    }\r\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/%s/%s\", a.Rig, a.Type, a.Name)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 4. Conflict Resolution Strategy\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype ConflictStrategy interface {\r\n    Resolve(left, right *Operation) (*Operation, error)\r\n    CanResolve(left, right *Operation) bool\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Built-in strategies\r\ntype LastWriteWins struct{}\r\ntype ThreeWayMerge struct{}\r\ntype LineBasedMerge struct{}\r\ntype CRDTMerge struct{}\r\ntype AIAssistedMerge struct{  // Use another AI agent to resolve\r\n    Model string\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Part III: Implementation Strategy\r\n\r\n### Phase 0: Design Agent-First VCS Specification\r\n\r\n**Deliverable:** Complete specification for agent-first VCS (this document + RFC)\r\n\r\n### Phase 1: Prototype with Jujutsu Backend\r\n\r\n**Rationale:** Jujutsu is closest to our requirements but not designed for agents.

Can we break from Git mental model entirely?\r\n\r\n4. **Scalability:** Can append-only operation log scale to 1M+ operations?\r\n\r\n5. **Privacy:** Agent operations may contain sensitive data - how to handle redaction/encryption?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\n**Git and Jujutsu were designed for humans.** An agent-first VCS requires rethinking from first principles:\r\n\r\n1. **Operation log as primary primitive** - Immutable, append-only, complete audit trail\r\n2. **Structured operations** - Typed, machine-readable by design\r\n3. **Automatic conflict resolution** - Pluggable strategies, no manual intervention\r\n4. **Event-driven orchestration** - Hooks, triggers, workflows as first-class citizens\r\n5. **Zero Framework Cognition** - All state derivable from filesystem\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:** Build agent-first VCS layer that can use Jujutsu (or Git) as storage backend while providing agent-optimized semantics. Start with Jujutsu backend for immediate benefits, evolve to custom backend as requirements crystallize.\r\n\r\n**This is not just about switching from Git to Jujutsu.

I recently found Beads and I'm considering integrating Gastown into my flow. I built a workflow wrapper on Beads called Parade so I could have a discovery layer and visualization of what is going on under the hood. \r\n\r\nOne of my biggest problem is I don't know what I don't know. When I start with a vague idea, I miss things - technical considerations I've never heard of, domain rules I didn't think to mention, existing patterns in my codebase I could reuse. The AI only knows to address what I bring up. \r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with a discovery layer that runs SME-style agents (technical, business domain, codebase context) to surface questions and considerations I wouldn't have thought to ask. It turns \"I want to build an expense tracker\" into a spec that includes things like approval workflows, audit logging, and integration points - stuff I would have discovered three days into building when something broke. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else felt this gap?
