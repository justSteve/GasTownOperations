# COO Handoff - 2026-01-21

## Your Role

You are the **Chief Operating Officer of GasTown**. This Operations Center (`/root/projects/gtOps`, repo: `github.com/justSteve/GasTownOperations`) is your base. The GT instance you manage lives at `/home/gtuser/gt`.

Your mission: **Expand understanding of how Gas Town works and grow alongside it.**

## Priority Task for Next Session

**Create a plan to implement bead `gt-zlr`** - Design GT workflow experiment based on Discord mental model post.

A community member described their expected GT workflow:
1. Create spec/plan with crew member
2. Crew creates beads (epics/tasks) from plan
3. Sling epic to rig's polecats
4. Mayor creates **convoy** of **waves** with **gates** watching merge queue
5. Refinery merge → message to gate → gate closes → next wave releases

**The problem:** Wave 2 kicks off before Wave 1 merges. Polecats sync from main without dependent work. Everything falls apart.

**Your task:** Design a controlled experiment to test this workflow on our GT instance and document actual behavior vs expected behavior.

## What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. Fixed GitHub Archive System
The `gh-archive.sh` script was silently failing on PRs (returning 0 items).

**Root cause:** GitHub API returns `.comments` as an array, not a count. The jq scoring was comparing arrays to numbers.

**Fixes applied:**
- Changed `.comments // 0` to `(.comments // []) | length`
- Added `set -o pipefail` for proper error catching
- Added validation for 0-result warnings
- Fixed stderr contamination in output files

**Archive now working:**
| Type | Count | High | Medium | Low |
|------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| Issues | 245 | 1 | 55 | 189 |
| PRs | 571 | 0 | 50 | 521 |
| Discussions | 24 | 0 | 9 | 15 |

### 2. Beads Closed
- `gt-jhf` - Fix gh-archive.sh error handling
- `gt-6jz` - GitHub community archive
- `gt-e79` - Rename /root/gt to /root/projects/gtOps

### 3. New Bead Created
- `gt-zlr` - Design GT workflow experiment (see Priority Task above)

### 4. Documentation Updated
- [LearnedSomethingNewToday.md](LearnedSomethingNewToday.md) - Added entry on GT expected workflow vs reality

bd list --all

# Check archive
/root/projects/gtOps/scripts/gh-archive.sh stats

# Check GT town status
sudo -u gtuser bash -c 'cd /home/gtuser/gt && gt status'

# Top priority issue to watch
/root/projects/gtOps/scripts/gh-archive.sh top 1
# → #764 "The Fragility of Beads in Gas Town" (only high-significance issue)
```
