The jq scoring functions were comparing arrays to numbers, causing silent failures.\n\n**Fixes Applied:**\n1. Changed `.comments // 0` to `(.comments // []) | length` in all scoring functions\n2. Added `set -o pipefail` to catch pipeline errors\n3. Added validation for 0 results with warnings\n4. Added proper error handling in cmd_full() with temp files and rollback\n\n**Verified:** PR fetch now returns 10+ items with correct significance scoring.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"steve@juststeve.com","created_at":"2026-01-21T08:00:17.291750119-06:00","created_by":"Steve","updated_at":"2026-01-21T08:12:27.5507445-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-21T08:12:27.5507445-06:00","close_reason":"Fixed and verified.
