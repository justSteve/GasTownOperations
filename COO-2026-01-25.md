# Handoff: COO Session - 2026-01-25

## Your Role

You are the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of GasTownOperations. Your mission is to expand understanding of how Gas Town works through observational learning, while maintaining operational health. Refer to `/root/projects/gtOps/AGENTS.md` for full role definition.

**First action**: Rename this file to remove "HANDOFF-" prefix:
```bash
mv HANDOFF-COO-2026-01-25.md COO-2026-01-25.md
```

## Session Summary

This session implemented the "everything-claude-code" development methodology in gtOps:

- **Created `.claude/rules/`** - 4 always-follow guidelines:
  - `tmux-interaction.md` - GT send-keys/capture-pane patterns
  - `dual-user.md` - root vs gtuser contexts
  - `knowledge-capture.md` - When to update learned/dontdo files
  - `session-hygiene.md` - Session start/end protocols

- **Created `.claude/commands/`** - 2 new slash commands:
  - `/handoff` - Create session handoff documents
  - `/health-check` - Quick GT status without full update

- **Created `.claude/skills/`** - 3 domain knowledge files:
  - `gt-commands.md` - GT CLI reference
  - `gt-architecture.md` - Agent roles, beads, molecules
  - `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and fixes

- **Created `.claude/hooks/`** - Session automation:
  - `hooks.json` - Hook configuration
  - `scripts/session-start.sh` - Handoff reminder

- **Updated** `.claude/settings.local.json` with new command permissions

## Current State

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| GT Version | `0.5.0 (dev: master@be96bb00)` |
| Doctor Passed | 52 |
| Doctor Warnings | 4 |
| Doctor Failed | 2 |
| Services | Stopped (daemon not running) |

## Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **agent-beads-exist**: `hq-deacon` and `hq-mayor` missing - prefix mismatch (upstream #591, #764)
2. **patrol-not-stuck**: ParseClipmate wisp stale since 2026-01-23 (may be false positive)
3. **zombie-sessions**: gt-user (tmux alive, Claude dead) - run `gt doctor --fix`
4. **daemon**: Not running - start with `gt daemon start` then `gt up`

## Open Work

- **Template extraction**: Current implementation is gtOps-specific. Next step is extracting reusable template for other properties.
- **Handoff files**: 2 older handoff files exist that should be renamed:
  - `HANDOFF-COO-2026-01-21.md`
  - `HANDOFF-COO-2026-01-23.md`

## Key Patterns

- New commands work: `/health-check` tested successfully, `/handoff` created this document
- Rules provide concise reference for tmux interaction, dual-user contexts
- Skills extracted from `gas-town-agent-reference.md` and `LearnedSomethingNewToday.md`
- Hook script detects handoff files and reminds to process them

## Quick Start

```bash
# Quick health check
/health-check

# Full update with sync
/gt-update

# Create handoff when done
/handoff
```
