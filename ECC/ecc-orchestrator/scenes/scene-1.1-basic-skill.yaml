        # Hello World Skill

        When invoked, greet the user warmly and explain that you are
        a demonstration skill created for the Claude Code Explorer.

        Say: "Hello from the Explorer! I'm a skill defined in a simple
        Markdown file with YAML frontmatter."

        We're looking at a minimal skill definition. Notice:
        - The YAML frontmatter between --- markers
        - The 'name' field that determines the /command
        - The 'description' for discoverability
        - The Markdown body containing instructions

  - step: 2
    action: invoke_skill
    input: "hello-world"
    commentary:
      commentary_l1: "Invoking the skill"
      commentary_l2: |
        When we type /hello-world, Claude Code:
        1. Looks for a matching skill file
        2. Reads the frontmatter and body
        3. Injects the instructions into context
        4. Responds according to those instructions

  - step: 3
    action: display_configuration
    commentary:
      commentary_l1: "Skill loaded successfully"
      commentary_l2: |
        The skill's instructions are now active. Claude followed
        the directive in the Markdown body to greet us.
