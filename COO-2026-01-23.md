## Your Role

You are the **Chief Operating Officer of GasTown**. This Operations Center (`/root/projects/gtOps`, repo: `github.com/justSteve/GasTownOperations`) is your base. The GT instance you manage lives at `/home/gtuser/gt`.

Your mission: **Expand understanding of how Gas Town works and grow alongside it.**

## Session Summary

Ran `/gt-update` and addressed several issues:

### Completed
| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Upstream sync | Already current (be96bb00) |
| priming (deacon AGENTS.md) | Reduced from 40 → 9 lines | ✓ Fixed |
| orphan/zombie sessions | Cleaned by doctor --fix | ✓ Fixed |
| clone-divergence | Switched DataArchive clones to `main` branch | ✓ Fixed |
| Stuck patrol wisp | Closed ParseClipmate-wisp-qdn | ✓ Fixed |
| ParseClipmate-8fr | Marked won't-fix (Windows-only project) |

### Investigations
1. **Orphaned agent input** - Mystery messages appeared in hq-mayor and gt-claude_monitor-refinery. Traced to orphaned input from crashed/interrupted agent sessions. Documented in LearnedSomethingNewToday.md.

2. **agent-beads-exist issue** - Researched upstream. Already well-covered by #591, #764. Root cause is beads prefix extraction bug. Non-blocking, GT still functions.

---

## Current State

### Doctor Status
| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Passed | 56 |
| Warnings | 1 (patrol-not-stuck - doctor bug, wisp is actually closed) |
| Failed | 1 (agent-beads-exist - known upstream issue) |

### GT Version
`0.5.0 (dev: master@be96bb00)` - up to date with upstream

### Services Running
```
hq-mayor, hq-deacon
gt-claude_monitor-witness, gt-claude_monitor-refinery
gt-parseClipmate-witness, gt-parseClipmate-refinery
gt-user (COO interaction terminal)
```

---

## Known Issues (Upstream - Not Actionable)

1. **agent-beads-exist**: `hq-deacon` and `hq-mayor` beads can't be created due to prefix mismatch. Tracked in #591, #764. GT functions without them.

2. **patrol-not-stuck false positive**: Doctor reports closed wisps as "stuck" - doesn't filter by status. Minor bug.

---

## Open Work

### Beads
- `gt-zlr` [P2] - Design GT workflow experiment (convoy/wave/gate testing)
- `gt-7ub` [epic] - tmux Enhancements
- ParseClipmate P3/P4 issues (database error handling, bare excepts, CDN, logging)

### Upstream PRs to Monitor
- PR #1257 - beads PrefixOverride fix

---

## Key Patterns

### GT Interaction (Primary Interface)
```bash
# Send command to GT
sudo -u gtuser tmux send-keys -t gt-user:main.0 'gt mayor status' Enter

# Capture output
sudo -u gtuser tmux capture-pane -t gt-user:main.0 -p -S -20

# Attach directly
sudo -u gtuser tmux attach -t hq-mayor
```

### Clearing Orphaned Agent Input
```bash
sudo -u gtuser tmux send-keys -t <session> Escape C-u
```
